### Metrics to Determine Winner
Individuals are predisposed toward each topic of interest. To be fair, we want to control for these
feelings and provide a fair metric that determines the winner of the debate. One metric is:

(Total In Favor Post) / (Total in Favor Pre)

We will use this metric to determine winners at each level.
