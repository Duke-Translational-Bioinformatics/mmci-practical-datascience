# Azure Machine Learning Intensive Lab
Together, we will compete against each other to build the best predictive
model. At the end of the competition, we will run everyone's best model
against all others and using `AUC` as a metric of "best", we will choose a
winner. This is akin to many data science competitions being held across
various platforms today. Some examples of these platforms are [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
and [Sage Bionetworks](http://sagebase.org/challenges/).

### Competition
Using a freely available dataset from Kaggle, we will work together to predict
readmission of diabetics. Again, the end goal is to derive the best features that
allow you to build the most accurate predictive model.

#### How will this work?
Within this folder, there are several additional [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files. That 
will help us modularize this activity. Here is an eagle eye view of all the steps
that we'll need to take to accomplish this goal on Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio.

1. [Getting the Data](get_diabetes_data.md)
2. [Creating the experiment in ML Studio](amlstudio_experiment_create.md)
3. [Feature Creation Example](feature_creation_example.md)
4. [Modeling](modeling.md)
5. [Deploy/Implementation](deploy_implementation.md)
